 * In order for a deadlock to occur, must have the following four conditions
 * met:
 * 1. Mutual Exclusion: Only one process can use a resource at a given time.
 * 2. Hold and Wait: Processes already holding a resource can request new ones.
 * 3. No Preemption: One process cannot forcibly remove another processâ€™
 * resource.
 * 4. Circular Wait: Two or more processes form a circular chain where each
 * process is waiting on another resource in the chain.
